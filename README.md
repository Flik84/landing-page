# landing-page

Assignment from the Odin Project Foundations Course. Students are to use HTML and CSS mimic the layout and styling of a website based on an image of the finished product and some basic font-related styling information.

I'm sure this layout could have been accomplished in far fewer steps, but I'm happy and surprised I was able to duplicate it to some accuracy.
Extra credit goes out to Jonas Schmedtmann and his HTML/CSS course on Udemy for helping to solidify the basics of Flexbox in my mind. That course as a whole is great for reinforcing concepts while working through the Odin Project.

I decided to personalize the page with some of my work in a different field.
